# blueberry_segmentation

Blueberry segmentation with Pytorch using Deep Blueberry data.

Database link: https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/deepblueberry-quantification-blueberries-wild-using-instance-segmentation#files.

The UNET architecture implementation was taken from https://github.com/usuyama/pytorch-unet.

I would suggest running the code in Colab, but have also included a .py file if anybody wants to train on their own machine. Also, much of my preprocessing code is very messy, I'm currently working on cleaning it up.
